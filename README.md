# Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-player-stastics
Football Players Analysis Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of football players across top leagues, utilizing advanced data processing and machine learning techniques. It aims to deliver insights on player performance metrics, enabling effective comparisons and visualizations.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reads and prepares a football player dataset with over 30 features, including age, position, goals per 90 minutes, expected goals, assists, and other advanced performance metrics.
Statistical Analysis: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize key performance metrics.
Machine Learning Models: Applies techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to predict and evaluate player performance.
Visualization: Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations that highlight trends and comparative player statistics.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Machine Learning: Models and metrics from Scikit-Learn, including feature selection and grid search for optimization.
